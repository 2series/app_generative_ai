What is Markdown syntax?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It is designed to be converted into HTML or other formats while remaining easy to read and write in its raw form. This feature makes it popular for writing on the web, as users can create formatted text (like headers, lists, italics, and bold text) using simple and readable symbols.
